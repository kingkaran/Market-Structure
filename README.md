# Market-Structure

This project is an attempt to learn full stack web development with Spring Framework, Apache Maven, Thymeleaf, and much more. By the end, I will have a skeleton structure for an online market store, which can be used as a template for any kind of business. I will be setting up payments using Stripe, and deploying the application on AWS.
